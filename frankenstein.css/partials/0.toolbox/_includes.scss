    1.  Settings
        Global variables that all partials can access. If you add a variable that you want to use across various partials you might want to consider adding it here.

    2.  Functions
        (hopefully) Useful functions.

    3.  Breakpoints
        The 'Breakpoints' section contains a list of global variables that represent different breakpoint sizes. They are separated from the 'Settings' section because they will make use of some functions, particularly em() and bp-size().

    4.  Mixins
        (hopefully) Useful mixins.
